Domain Finder v1.0

WHAT IS IT?
Domain Finder lets you search https://domainr.com for a domain based on your search criteria. It will let you then go to one of the available registrars and register it. Domain Finder will also tell you if a domain is taken or available so you know straight away whether the domain you want is yours for the taking.
